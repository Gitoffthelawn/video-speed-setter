Sometimes there is a video in which useful information, but the speaker speaks very slow 😡 so we always need to speed up videos.

You will tell me that some sites have speed control, why i need your useless extensions? 🙄

😜 Well, most sites have options such as 1.25x, 1.5 and 2.0 but using this extension you are able to select any speed you want and this gives you greater experience because you can use any that suits your needs.

## How to use it?
it's semple and very easy to use. 😏

- Click on the toolbar extensions icon or use the shortcut ```Alt+K``` to open the popup, then type the playback speed that you want.

- You can also use the mouse scroll on the input field to set the speed.

**Note that the change is applied immediate to the video. 😏**

### This process is too slow, right? 🤔

- If you want to save more time, use the shortcuts ```Alt+L``` & ```Alt+J``` to increase or decrease the playback speed by 0.1 😏
